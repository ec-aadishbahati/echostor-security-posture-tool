REQUIREMENTS:
1. Executive summary must be business-focused, not technical
2. Identify 3-5 cross-cutting themes that span multiple domains
3. Prioritize initiatives by: (impact × urgency) / effort
4. Map dependencies: higher-priority items that must complete before others
5. Success metrics must be specific and measurable
6. Quick wins must be achievable in <30 days with low effort
7. Long-term strategy should align with industry best practices

Keep response professional and actionable for executive audience.
