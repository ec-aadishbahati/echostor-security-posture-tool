"""
Dry-run migration preview script

This script shows what would be migrated without changing the database.
It connects to the database and shows:
- How many responses would be affected
- Sample transformations (Question X: '1' → 'quarterly')
- Questions with no responses
- Responses that would be skipped (already slugs)
