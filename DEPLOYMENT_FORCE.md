# Deployment Force File

This file is used to force a new Vercel deployment when configuration changes don't automatically trigger a rebuild.

## Issue
The frontend deployment was showing 404 even after PR #13 successfully removed the incompatible rewrites configuration. This file change should force Vercel to pick up the latest configuration and deploy properly.

## Expected Result
The frontend at https://echostor-security-posture-tool.vercel.app should load the EchoStor Security Posture Assessment landing page instead of showing a 404 error.
